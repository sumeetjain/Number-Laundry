# About Us

## Why did you make this?

We needed clean phone numbers and [Twilio](http://twilio.com/) international rates lookups for a project of ours called [Bumble](http://bumblephone.com). We built something quickly and realized it was pretty handy. So, we decided it would be nice to provide this service to anyone else who needed it.

## Who are you?

We're [What Cheer](http://whatcheer.com), a web design and development studio located in [Omaha, Nebraska](http://iliveinomaha.com/). We make fancy websites.
